## Merha!👋
### I'm Najwa Maulida Rahma but you can call me Najuu, or anything suits you🤗

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub. I'm a curious soul who's just starting out in the world of software development — still learning, still growing, but loving every step of it. You know what they say: _"Pursue your dream!"_

## 🌱 A bit about me

I’m diving into the world of code, trying to build things that work, look good, and maybe even mean something. When I get stuck (which happens more than I’d like to admit 😅), I turn to music to clear my head.

I'm a big fan of **Zutomayo**, and I also really enjoy artists like **LuckLife** and **Milet** — mostly depens on the mood🎶. Music helps me reconnect with emotion, rhythm, and story — kind of like writing, which I’ve always loved.

Lately, I’ve realized that **coding can feel just like writing**: expressing something meaningful, whether it’s obvious or hidden in the details.

## ✨ Fun facts

- Anime fan 🍿 (from chill slice-of-life to wild fantasy adventures)
- I believe every project holds meaning — seen or unseen
- I write (concepts of) stories when I'm not writing code
- I’m here to **learn**, **build**, and hopefully **connect** with people who feel the same
